# Script for fetching the imdb api data for budget and revenue for each movie in our dataset

# 1. Import raw dataset
# 2. Iterate through df
# 3. Save the imdb id
# 4. API call with that id
# 5. Parse the json for revenue and budget
# 6. Maybe process them if needed
# 7. If there are values, write them in the budget and revenue column of the df
# 8. If not, do nothing
